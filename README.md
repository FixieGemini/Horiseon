# Horiseon-Semantic-Refactor
## Description
The purpose of this project is to optimize Horiseon's digital marketing website.
Adding a more descriptive title and alternate descriptions to the images within the html increases accessibility and S.E.O.
There were some ineffeciencies in the code as well that were addressed with the use of semantic elements.
These changes should make the website not only more searchable and accessible but easier to maintain and change in the future!
